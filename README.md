# tja2fumen .net

This is a C# port of the [tja2fumen](https://github.com/vivaria/tja2fumen) python library made by [vivaria](https://github.com/vivaria).

This library was ported almost 1:1 to the original one, so it's not made with a great codebase due to the differences of Python and C#.

It's made as a library for it to be used by [TekaTeka](https://github.com/Renzo904/TekaTeka) and not like a single program. If you want to convert your own tja files, please use the original python program
